		<h2>On Human Rights Day, A Thought On Human Rights</h2>
		<time datetime='2015-12-10'>December 10th 2015</time>
		<p>It's tempting, given their modular presentation, to see human rights as a collection of related, but independent rights; like a set of baseball cards. The right not to be enslaved, that's one human right over here, and the right to a fair trial and public hearing, that's another, over there. You want to collect the whole set, but while it's incomplete, you still get to enjoy what you do have. <a href='human-rights-day-2015.html' title="Continue reading Jo's post on the holistic nature of human rights.">Continue Reading</a></p>

		<h2>As for the foxes, so for the poor.</h2>
		<time datetime='2015-5-30'>May 30th 2015</time>
		<p>The proposed repeal of the fox hunting ban by a government with so little moral integrity they make Ted Bundy look like a Samaritan is hardly surprising. People are furious. Mostly, those people are focusing on how abhorrent such a thing would be for foxes. This, I imagine, comes from their not being ruthless, amoral psychopaths.<a href='as-for-the-foxes.html' title="Continue reading Jo's blog post about the relationship between the repeal of the fox-hunting ban and human rights">Continue Reading</a></p>


		<h2>Let's Be Honest About Mental Health.</h2>
		<time datetime='2015-3-17'>March 17th 2015</time>
		<p>Here are two not particularly interesting facts about me: firstly, I see a therapist. Secondly, I'm not ashamed about the first fact. <a href='lets-be-honest-about-mental-health.html' title="Continue reading Jo's blog post about the importance of honesty and openness around mental health">Continue Reading</a></p>

		<h2>My favourite thing about quitting Facebook.</h2>
		<time datetime='2015-3-05'>March 5th 2015</time>
		<p>Remember the not-even-particularly-old days, when friends used to text you - specifically you - to invite you to their birthday? <a href='quitting-facebook.html' title="Continue reading Jo's blog post on her favourite thing about quitting Facebook">Continue reading</a></p>


		<h2>Reverse engineering happiness</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-11-16'>November 16th 2014</time>
		<p><em>Please forgive (and be prepared for) my briefly nauseating prose.</em></p>

		<p>Imagine for a moment that you live in a world where there is no such thing as money. Wealth and poverty have no anchor to tie themselves to and your options in life are not relative to your financial status. All your decisions are made out of personal preference, based on what would make you happy, not what you can 'afford'. <a href='reverse-engineering-happiness.html' title="Continue reading Jo's blog post on reverse engineering happiness">Continue Reading</a></p>	

		<h2>Give and Tell Challenge</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-9-30'>September 30th 2014</time>
		<p>Last month, Laura Kalbag nominated me for the Give and Tell Challenge. Here's the deal: pick a charity that <em>you</em> really care about, donate, blog about why that charity matters to you and then nominate 3 more people to do the same. Let's spread the love, raise awareness about some important causes and inspire others to join in as well. <a href='give-and-tell.html' title="Continue reading about Jo's give and tell challenge">Continue Reading</a></p> 

		<h2>I am a guinea pig.</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-7-19'>July 19th 2014</time>
		<p>Not literally, obviously. I do however like a good experiment, and who better to use than myself? Let's see what a super strict bodybuilders pre-competition diet does to me...physically and psychologically.<a href='guinea-pig.html' title="Continue reading about Jo's encounter with shredding">Continue Reading</a></p>

		<h2>Drip...drip...drip.</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-7-15'>July 15th 2014</time>
		<p>Well folks, today, amid the chokingly thick smokescreen that is a strategically timed cabinet reshuffle, I did something drastic. No, not that. Today, I wrote to my MP, <a href='http://www.simonkirby.org'>Simon Kirby</a>...<a href='drip.html' title="Continue reading Jo's letter to Simon Kirby about the emergency DRIP bill">Continue Reading</a></p> 

		<h2>Muscles and Misogyny</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-7-11'>July 11th 2014</time>
		<p>I'm used to getting baffled responses when I tell people I want to be a competitive bodybuilder. It's something Iâ€™ve come to expect. I suspect a lot of people assume that that means I want to become a female Arnie, so muscular my biceps tear my sleeves, so broad I have to walk through doors sideways. That's not what I want, although even if it was, there really isn't anything wrong that, if that's what makes a person happy.<a href='muscles-and-misogyny.html' title="Continue reading Jo's blog post on misogyny and bodybuilding">Continue Reading</a><p>


		<h2>Thinking Digital Reply</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-5-28'>May 28th 2014</time>
		<p>A big part of the Indie Tech movement is educating people about the issues that motivate us to seek alternatives. To that end, I feel it's important to clear up a couple of ambiguities in Ian Forrester's <a href='http://cubicgarden.com/2014/05/25/how-can-we-ever-trust-the-stacks/'>blog post</a> on <a href='http://www.aralbalkan.com'>Aral's</a> talk, <a href='http://indietech.org/video'>'Free Is A Lie'</a>. As a proud member of the Indie Phone team and a passionate advocate of Indie Tech, some of the discussed nuances are too important not to clarify.<a href='tdc-reply.html' title="Continue reading Jo's response to Ian's blog post">Continue Reading</a></p>





		<h2>First blog post for Indie Phone</h2>
		<time datetime='2014-5-20'>May 20th 2014</time>
		<p>It's been up on the <a href='http://indiephone.eu'>Indie Phone</a> site for a few weeks. It was an interesting event, hopefully that translates to an interesting <a href='http://indiephone.eu/newsletter/2014-04-30/'>read</a>.</p>

		<h2>The Power of words.</h2>
		<time datetime="2014-01-07">January 7th, 2014</time>

		<p>Well, clearly it's been far too long since I added an update. It's been a busy month (partly with web stuff, although not as much as I'd like; partly with other work stuff and partly with the seemingly unavoidable madness that descends on the UK for the entire month of December), but now, I feel compelled to sit down and dedicate an evening to filling in the gaps...<a href='power-of-words.html' title='Continue reading blog post about The Power of Words'>[Read More...]</a></p> 
	 

		<h2>Handheld Conference and a Whole Lot of Gesticulation</h2>
		<time datetime="2013-12-05">December 5th, 2013</time>
			
		<p>So, last week was a week of many firsts for me; first ever web conference, first trip to Wales and first experience of completely and utterly losing my voice. That the third coincided with the first and second was, as you can imagine, a slight annoyance. Luckily, I had a couple of lovely friends ready to introduce me with the caveat "This is Jo, she doesn't have a voice." which I hope made my grouchy demeanour and frantic hand gestures seem (at least slightly) less odd. <a href='handheld.html' title='Read more about Handheld Conference and a Whole Lot of Gesticulation'>[Read more...]</a></p>

		<h2>Watch this space...</h2>
		<time datetime="2013-11-26">November 26th, 2013</time>

		<p>Well, folks, here is where you will find my blog entries. As I travel along this road, building my skills, making new friends, finding my way into this new, exciting world (jeez, sound like Dorothy much?), this is where I'll take it all down. I'll be back from a mega exciting conference at the weekend, hopefully with a hundred and one awesome things to write about. If y'all could send me soothing thoughts, I'd appreciate it. I'm not entirely sure how one 'networks' with severe laryngitis. I guess I'm about to find out.</p>
