		<p>So, last week was a week of many firsts for me; first ever web conference, first trip to Wales and first experience of completely and utterly losing my voice. That the third coincided with the first and second was, as you can imagine, a slight annoyance. Luckily, I had a couple of lovely friends ready to introduce me with the caveat "This is Jo, she doesn't have a voice." which I hope made my grouchy demeanour and frantic hand gestures seem (at least slightly) less odd.</p>


		<p>Now although my vocal inadequacy did indeed make 'networking' something of a challenge - if not an impossibility - it certainly didn't prevent me from benefiting a great deal from the event. One thing I was concerned about prior to attending was that, due to my relative ignorance in the field, I would be completely lost from the word go. This wasn't the case. Don't get me wrong, there were moments when I didn't have a clue what was being talked about (I'd have been slightly concerned if that hadn't been the case, what with my overt awareness of The Dunning-Kruger effect - see below if you've not been lucky enough to encounter this wonderful, Nobel Prize winning piece of research before) but I pushed through, stuck with it and for the most part, reached the end of each talk feeling like I'd genuinely learnt at least something!</p>

		<p>Now, to simplify to a spectacular degree, here are a couple of the important things I took from Handheld:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><p>Don't forget your priorities - If you're building a website, chances are you want to communicate a message. Nice as it is to make that message pretty and elaborate, remember that it is first and foremost about the message. If all else fails, if your site ends up being viewed on some historic device deserving of a place alongside Babbage's Difference Engine, your message should still come across.</p></li>

			<li><p>Consider your audience - Whilst not really relevant to me yet (since I'm not currently building complex sites with varied audiences of broadly ranging abilities, from personal curiosity to academic elite), the cognitive scientist in me latched onto this point as 'one for the future'. When building a site likely to attract an audience with a diverse range of backgrounds, consider whether those different backgrounds are going to affect how your audience would want the site presented to them and, consequently, how they'll respond to the way you <em>do</em> present it to them. If you're building a website consisting solely of photos of animals in tuxedos, you can probably be fairly confident that anyone actively seeking your site is going to be viewing it from the same perspective, i.e. a sincere appreciation of the crossroads wherein dapper and adorable collide. </p>

			<p>On the other hand, if you're building a website dealing with, for example, a complex technical or scientific issue, you should probably consider the fact that some people who visit your website are going to be novices whilst others may be world leading experts in the field. It's unlikely that the same content will be equally as appropriate for both. Thus, responsive web design doesn't just mean responding to different browsers and different devices, but also different audiences.</p>

			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>OK. The Dunning-Kruger effect, just in case you really are curious; this fantastic piece of psychology research won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Psychology. It's basically a study confirming what we've all suspected for a long time: Empty vessels do indeed make the most noise - these lovely researchers looked at confidence levels relative to actual knowledge of a specified field. Turns out, if you think you know everything, it's more than likely you know bugger all. If you think you know bugger all, you might be starting to understand the scope of the field and as your confidence level develops from this point, chances are your actual knowledge is a fair bit above what you think it is. My favourite finding, however, is that even a 100% bonafide genius still doesn't have the confidence of a moron. Aaaaaaaand, boom; suddenly many of the problems facing humanity today make a lot more sense, yes?</p>

		<p>I felt kinda bad for this guy. He clearly started his career the last time moustaches were cool, and hasn't moved with the times. A lesson for us all!</p>
