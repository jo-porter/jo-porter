	<p>Last month <a href='http://www.laurakalbag.com'>Laura Kalbag</a> nominated me for the "Give and Tell Challenge" after she donated to the charity <a href='https://allout.org'>All Out</a> and <a href='http://laurakalbag.com/give-and-tell-challenge'>blogged</a> on her motivations for doing so.</p> 

	<p>The charity I've chosen to donate to is a little known organisation, based in Tanzania, called <a href='http://www.apopo.org'>Apopo</a>.</p> 

	<p>Apopo are a bizarre but wonderful charity who have discovered an effective, low-tech solution to one of Africa's cruellest conflict remnants: land mines.</p> 

	<p>Since 2000, Apopo have been training and working with giant African pouched rats (who are too light to set off the mines, but equally as keen-nosed as dogs) to sniff out land mines, allowing them to be safely disarmed or detonated and the land to be subsequently returned to the local community.</p>

	<p>In the years since Apopo began mine detection, in Mozambique alone they have cleared nearly 10,000,000m<sup>2</sup> of land and returned it to the population, with 6,693 land mines found and neutralised across the area.</p>

	<p>A few years after they began mine detection, Apopo received funding for research into applying the techniques developed there to TB detection. It turns out, a giant African pouched rat is far more efficient and reliable than any other tuberculosis screening technique currently available, and each rat is able to evaluate more samples in 10 minutes than a lab technician can in an entire day.</p>

	<p>Here's why I choose Apopo for my Give and Tell Challenge:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Land mines pose a cruel, enduring threat to the lives of innocent people, stunting development and forcing communities to live in fear. Apopo are working hard to change that.</li>
		<li>Tuberculosis remains a massive cause of suffering in the developing world, and more reliable, early detection will be key to curbing its spread.</li>
		<li>Rats are beautiful, intelligent creatures and this is their chance to shine!</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>On top of which, Apopo's work serves as an important reminder of the role of simplicity in changing the world. Yes, it takes a brilliant mind to create new solutions to old problems; but looking at a problem and realising the solution has been right there in front of you all along, twitching its nose and scratching in the dirt; that's a brilliance that deserves recognition too.</p>

	<h2>Give and/or Tell</h2>

	<p>As Laura mentioned in her own post, supporting charitable causes can take on many different forms, and at different times we may find ourselves in a position to donate money, our time, or spread the word of an organisation's efforts. So, with this in mind, I nominate <a href='https://twitter.com/GeorgeMacR'>George MacRorie</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/ffffux'>Lena Reinhardt</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/badgermind'>Robin Taylor</a> 	to give and/or tell.</p> 

	<h2>Apopo</h2>

	<p>Furthermore, if I've convinced you of just how awesome Apopo are and you you'd like to donate to them as well, you can do so <a href='http://www.apopo.org/en/donate'>here</a> and if, like me, you want to learn as much as possible about Apopo's work, you can <a href='http://www.apopo.org/en/adopt'>adopt a rat</a> and receive regular updates on her training and progress towards helping to change the world!</p>
