	<h2>Why Jules, not Jo?</h2>

	<p>So I decided to change my name. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, and now I'm actually doing it. I bet <strong>you</strong> are awesome enough to just say "OK, cool", but for anyone else who might ask why, here's why: </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Because it's unrealistic to expect someone to meet you for the first time, at the moment you're born, and guess the right name for you for the rest of your life.</li>
		<li>Because acknowleding your own right to self-determination is an awesome way to help you appreciate and understand the value of the right to self-determination for all people.</li>
		<li>Because reflecting on your own identity is a wonderful, growing, learning thing to do for yourself.</li>
		<li>Because it's <strong>my</strong> name, why shouldn't I be the one to decide it?</li>
	</ol>

		<p>I could write essays on why this matters to me, the associations the name Jo has accumulated for me over the past three decades, my attitudes towards my identity now and my identity in years since past, but there's a danger in justifying too readily things which need no justification. When it comes to your own identity, in any of its facets, that's for you to decide, and for others to respect.</p> 

		<p>This is a process. It turns out that in the vast social, digital and bureaucratic tapestry with which our lives and identities are interwoven, changing your name can be a complex exercise. It will take time, but here's where it begins.</p>

	<h2>Hi, I'm Jules.</h2>
