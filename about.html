<h2>OK. What's to know?</h2>

<p>I'm a diverse mixture of many loves and curiosities. These include; Philosophy, Politics, Robotics, Ethics, Symbolic Logic, Rock climbing, Weight Lifting, Animals...you get the picture. It's rare to find something I'm not interested in.</p>

<p>I studied Philosophy and Cognitive Science at university, funding my way through it working in the fitness industry; training, motivating and (hopefully) inspiring my clients.</p>

 <p>I loved my degree because it shaped me as a person, gave me an <strong>unquenchable thirst for knowledge</strong> and taught me how to <strong>see through the quagmire of bullshit</strong> we find ourselves facing on a daily basis. I love my job because I get to <strong>help people achieve awesome things</strong>. I also love it because when I go to work, I get to <strong>make a positive contribution</strong> to my clients' lives.</p>



<h3>And there you have it, my ethos for life<h3>

<h4>In with:</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Knowledge</li>
		<li>Awesome things</li>
		<li>Positive Contributions</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Out with:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Bullshit</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>So why do I want to be a Web Developer?</h4>

	<p>I love creativity. I love rules. I love technology. I want to be a part of something that takes all three, bundles them together and decorates them with a kick-ass bow.</p>
