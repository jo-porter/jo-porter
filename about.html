	<h2>OK. What's to know?</h2>

	<p>I'm a diverse mixture of many loves and curiosities. These include; Philosophy, Politics, Robotics, Ethics, Symbolic Logic, Rock climbing, Weight Lifting, Animals...you get the picture. It's rare to find something I'm not interested in.</p>
	
	<p>I studied Philosophy and Cognitive Science at university, funding my way through it working in the fitness industry; training, motivating and (hopefully) inspiring my clients.</p>
	
	<p>I loved my degree because it shaped me as a person, gave me an <strong>unquenchable thirst for knowledge</strong> and taught me how to <strong>see through the quagmire of bullshit</strong> we find ourselves facing on a daily basis. I love my job because I get to <strong>help people achieve awesome things</strong>. I also love it because when I go to work, I get to <strong>make a positive contribution</strong> to my clients' lives.</p>

</div>

<h2>And there it is, my ethos for life.</h2>

	<h3>In with:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Knowledge</li>
			<li>Awesome things</li>
			<li>Positive Contributions</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Out with:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bullshit</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>So what's the plan?</h2>

	<p>If there's one thing in life that terrifies me more than anything else, it's boredom. Consequently I tend to have a myriad of projects running concurrently. Right now <a href='http://www.indiephone.eu'>Indie Phone</a> is my top priority but it's by no means the only thing that matters to me.</p>

	<p>I initially became involved within Indie Phone as a mentee of <a href='http://www.aralbalkan.com'>Aral Balkan</a> and <a href='http://www.laurakalbag.com'>Laura Kalbag</a>, both of whom taught me a great deal about web development and design. These are skills I hope to continue building on, along with learning as much about the development of new technologies and innovations, as I navigate my way through the tech world.
	</p>

	<p>Keen to be as multifaceted an individual as possible, I am currently preparing to enter my first bodybuilding competition in early 2015. My good intentions are to blog my way through the entire process; from the physical, to the psychological and even the philosophical aspects of the journey.</p>

	<p>Of course, throughout, I shall continue to cuddle dogs so enthusiastically that they raise one eyebrow and back away slowly; approach street cats so eagerly that they roll their eyes and scan for the nearest tree; and generally make a nuisance of myself to anything with four legs and fur...and some things without.</p>
