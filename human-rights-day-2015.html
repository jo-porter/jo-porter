	<h2>On Human Rights Day, A Thought On Human Rights</h2>

	<h3>Collect 'em all</h3>

	<p>It's tempting, given their modular presentation, to see human rights as a collection of related, but independent rights; like a set of baseball cards. The right not to be enslaved, that's one human right over here, and the right to a fair trial and public hearing, that's another, over there. You want to collect the whole set, but while it's incomplete, you still get to enjoy what you do have.</p>

	<p>We could look around the world and conclude that some societies do better on human rights than others. Slavery and servitude is still rife in many countries, while comparatively rare in others. The right to a nationality? Well plenty of nations are doing at least reasonably well on that front, so let's all pat ourselves on the back.</p>

	<p>Yes we can quantify, in bloodshed, differing degrees of awful brutality among nation states. Each human rights abuser has their own, individual approach; some are more brash and blatant about it within their own borders, while others, engaged in endless global conflict, flaunt their disregard for the humanity of 'the other'. </p>

	<p>It's easy to look at a state that murders those that question its authority and declare them a human rights abuser that must be stopped, while taking a softer view on the state that quietly and surreptitiously restructures society in such a way that simply ensures its power in perpetuity. The active abuses of some human rights undeniably leave a more immediately visible mark, and this, it seems, can lead us into a dangerous perception of hierarchy. After all, if your rights are being abused, but you're not aware of it, are you really suffering at all? If a right can be abused without you even noticing, is it really that big of a deal?</p>

	<p>The trouble is, human rights are not like a set of baseball cards. They're not a crowdsourced catalogue of <em>Societies Favourite Freedoms: The Results Are In!</em> They're not a 'they' at all. They're an it. </p>

	<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an holistic document, an intricately dissected description of the elements which make up our humanity, and weakening any one element is akin to just taking one stone out of the bridge, or just removing one of your vertebrae.</p>

	<h3>Privacy</h3>

	<p>Take privacy, a vertebra currently being subjected to an extensive campaign of demonisation by governments throughout the world. Privacy, they say, is just one right, and the benefits of weakening just this tiny little right will greatly outweigh the costs. But the loss of privacy doesn't simply affect our freedom to speak to a loved one safe in the knowledge that nobody is listening in. Instead it transfers the ultimate power to those with the self-assigned right to listen. Information is power, just ask any ex-Scientologist who's ever tried to stand up against the church; the church in possession of every secret, every regret, ever hidden shame they ever saw fit to share.</p>

	<p>"If you've nothing to hide you've nothing to fear" echoes Goebells in the not so distant past. But don't be mistaken; you don't need a dark criminal past to fear the consequences of a loss of privacy. Indeed, when it comes to psychological manipulation, it's often the experiences we've been subjected to, rather than instigated, that leave us most vulnerable. </p>

	<p>With enough information, any person, or indeed any group, can be guided, unwittingly and without protest, into compliance and submission. Advertisers and marketers depend upon it, and as the grieving father who received a letter from an office supply chain addressed to 'Daughter Killed in Car Crash' can attest, nothing is out of bounds. Without privacy we have no protection against manipulation. The choices we make as subjects of manipulation are not our choices, any more than the sheep herded into the pen chose to be there.</p>

	<h3>Ripples in a pond</h3>

	<p>If you've ever opted not to say something in private for fear that it might not actually be private, then you've also lost the right to free speech. If you've ever chosen not to read up on something online because of how someone else might interpret your desire to learn about a given subject, then your right to education, free thought and free expression have all been hit. These rights do not exist in isolation, they're an ecosystem, entirely dependent on one another. Lose one and others quickly become compromised and like ripples in a pond, our losses expand.</p>

	<p>The enjoyment of each and every human right depends on the upholding of every other right. The successful relationship between state and civilians depends upon an equilibrium of power, and The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed to reflect that. History (and indeed the present) shows us what happens when the balance swings too far in the state's favour. Allowing the degradation of any human right has that effect, not only in the loss of itself, but in the weakening of the whole.</p>

	<p>Human rights are a bridge on which we must all stand; every stone as essential as the next. If we want to stay dry, we need to recognise that.</p>
