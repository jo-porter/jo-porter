	<p>Well folks, today, amid the chokingly thick smokescreen that is a strategically timed cabinet reshuffle, I did something drastic. No, not that. Today, I wrote to my MP, <a href='http://www.simonkirby.org'>Simon Kirby</a>.</p> 

	<p>Last week, <a href='http://laurakalbag.com'>Laura Kalbag</a> took a great deal of time and effort to write to him, calling on him to take a stand against the DRIP bill, only to receive a meaningless, generic, click n' send response. AKA, an insult. Undeterred, I thought I'd give it another go and see whether I could elicit something a little more human...from a politician. I'm nothing if not an optimist.</p>

	<p>Now just in case Mr Kirby doesn't give my email the time it deserves, I thought I'd share it with you too.</p>

	<p>Dear Mr Kirby,</p>

	<p>I am writing to you after a colleague of mine received a disappointing response to an email she wrote to you last week. I hope that you will do me the decency of responding to me, not with some prewritten, blanket response email but with your own views, sincerely and honestly.</p>

	<p>Unsurprisingly, this email regarded the current efforts by David Cameron to rush through a piece of supposedly 'emergency' surveillance legislation. The emergency being, presumably, that the government might otherwise actually have to give decent, law abiding members of society some semblance of privacy and the freedom to carry out their personal lives without the threat of vast quantities of 'meta data' being stockpiled about them.</p>

	<p>Mr Kirby, I will make this very, very simple for you. Privacy, is a human right. Article 12 of the UNIVERSAL Declaration of Human Rights states,</p>

	<p>"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."</p>

	<p>Privacy, Mr Kirby, is as much a fundamental human right as the right to a fair trial, the right to be free from slavery, the right to life. If David Cameron can find excuses to rob us of one of these rights, what's to stop him from doing the same with the others?</p>

	<p>There's a name for using extreme, improbable threats to convince people of their need to sacrifice things which they otherwise wouldn't: scaremongering. This is exactly what is happening every time the "Terrorists and Paedophiles" buzz-phrase is wielded out and paraded around in front of people like a poorly shackled King Kong.</p> 

	<p>Yes, terrorists are real and yes, paedophiles are real. <em>Without</em> this piece of legislation we must live with the knowledge that maybe, if we're very unlucky, someday something bad might happen to someone we know.</p>

	<p>If we live <em>with</em> this piece of legislation, we will be living with the knowledge that every one of us has lost something very precious. Something which the United Nations, through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights deemed to be as fundamental as all other human rights, including the right to life. It is not for the government to decide which of our rights can be sacrificed, any more than it is for terrorists to decide.</p> 

	<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>


	<p>Jo Porter</p>

	<p>And now, we wait.</p>
