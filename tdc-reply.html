<p>A big part of the Indie Tech movement is educating people about the issues that motivate us to seek alternatives. To that end, I feel it's important to clear up a couple of ambiguities in Ian Forrester's <a href='http://cubicgarden.com/2014/05/25/how-can-we-ever-trust-the-stacks/'>blog post</a> on <a href='http://www.aralbalkan.com'>Aral's</a> talk, <a href='http://indietech.org/video'>'Free Is A Lie'</a>. As a proud member of the Indie Phone team and a passionate advocate of Indie Tech, some of the discussed nuances are too important not to clarify.</p>

<p>Ian states that he <em>"disagree[s that] open source and free software is a lie, waste of time and not really free"</em></p>

<p>Free is a problematic word because it has two meanings in English: free as in cost and free as in liberty. When Aral talks about 'free being a lie' - the free he is referring to is <strong>not</strong> free as in liberty. 


<p>The free being referred to is the 'free' of venture capital backed, closed silos (which stand in direct opposition to the Free Software Movement). It is the 'free' of Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter, etc.  - organisations who offer us 'free' services in exchange for ownership and control of our personal data.</p>


<p>This 'free' is a lie. At best, this is a concealed trade; at worst, an epic deception.</p>



<p><em>"Picking the low hanging fruit is certainly entertaining but is unfair, for example Mozilla's dependence on Google is eye watering but there was no mention of Ubuntu, with their own phone, tablet, TV and computer operating system. I mean Ubuntu totally redesigned their operating environments to work consistently across all of them."</em></p>


<p>This distinction between criticising Mozilla, but not mentioning Ubuntu seems to miss the point. Indie Tech's issue with Mozilla is the vested interest caused by <strong>90%</strong> of their revenue coming from Google. It's difficult to take an organisation seriously when they claim to be fighting for one thing, whilst simultaneously surviving on earnings from a company that represents the antithesis of their supposed cause. That is the issue with Mozilla.</p>


<p>Concerning Ian's suggestion that Aral's talk was missing a 'call to action', I can't help but feel that 'Free Is A Lie' is a call to action. It's an admission that the path we're on right now is a treacherous one and we should all be working on, or at least supporting, alternatives. Those alternatives being Indie Tech products, of which <a href='http://indiephone.eu'>Indie Phone</a> is just one example.</p>


<p>So not only are we calling others to action, we're already acting ourselves.</p>


<p>Ian's ethos of being more proactive in protecting your own digital rights is admirable, but there are a number of reasons why, in reality, it just isn't that simple:</p>


<p>Sure, "read the EULA" is not bad advice. Unfortunately, it would take an infeasible amount of time to do it across the board. <a href='http://techland.time.com/2012/03/06/youd-need-76-work-days-to-read-all-your-privacy-policies-each-year/'>(76 Working days, to be precise)</a>.</p>


<p>On top of which, even if you did, it's unlikely you could make sense of an esoteric legal document specifically designed to confuse and frustrate. Furthermore, when all the services we use have similar EULAs, what difference does reading them really make? Shutting yourself off from technology is no longer a viable option; it has become too much a part of our lives. This is why alternatives are key.</p>


<p>Evaluating the services you use based on cost in time, privacy and ownership would be fine, if we all had the knowledge to accurately gauge those costs. How much is your privacy worth? How much is it worth, to you, to keep private the details of your medical records, your political activity, your sexual history, or any other multitude of things? Given how little we know about how our information is currently used, let alone how it may be used in the future, any evaluation we made on the topic would be crude at best and would more likely be dangerously inaccurate.</p>



<p>We love that Ian took the time to write such a detailed response to Aral's talk, and we hope this reply has helped answer some of the questions about the Indie Tech movement and our motivations.</p>


<p>We believe what he perceived as 'scaremongering' is in fact, simply the discussion of a society which has yet to be created. And as George Bernard Shaw pointed out,</p>


<p>"The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them."</p>
