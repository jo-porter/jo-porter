	<h3>Handheld Conference and a Whole Lot of Gesticulation</h3>

As I travel along this road, building my skills, making new friends, finding my way into this new, exciting world (jeez, sound like Dorothy much?), this is where I'll take it all down. I'll be back from a mega exciting conference at the weekend, hopefully with a hundred and one awesome things to write about. If y'all could send me soothing thoughts, I'd appreciate it. I'm not entirely sure how one 'networks' with severe laryngitis. I guess I'm about to find out.</p>
