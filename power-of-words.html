<h2>The Power of words.</h2>

	<p>Well, clearly it's been far too long since I added an update. It's been a busy month (partly with web stuff, although not as much as I'd like; partly with other work stuff and partly with the seemingly unavoidable madness that descends on the UK for the entire month of December), but now, I feel compelled to sit down and dedicate an evening to filling in the gaps.</p> 

	<p>After the energising buzz of handheld I've been putting my web time into learning about the CSS Box Model, the importance of working from a baseline grid and the power of white space...and more. Aral's been his usual, patient self, ensuring we build on solid foundations and never allowing me to simply accept that something 'just is' the way it is.</p>

	<p>I've spent a lot of my free time playing with various tools and haphazardly throwing things together, more for the sake of learning the methods than creating anything beautiful; and then, thankfully, being set back on the right path by Aral.</p> 

	<p>During our last lesson we covered what seemed like a huge amount. Aral pointed out, quite rightly, that I was depending very heavily on colour to create flow and structure to my page which, given my desire to focus on content-first web developing, was not ideal.</p>

	<p>So first things first, back to monochrome, remove all distractions and then see whether the text itself actually possesses the flow we want it to. No. So what now? We'd previously talked briefly about working from a baseline grid and I had set a base line-height of 30 pixels, which was fine, but looking at the page, now without the distraction of superfluous colours, it was clear to see that not everything was consistently working to that base.</p> 

	<p>In order to fix that I not only needed to ensure everything was a multiple (or tidy fraction) of my line-height but also work out what multiple or fraction it should be.</p>

	<p>Aral used the incredibly helpful analogy of magnets. My main page heading was stuck right up at the top, essentially clinging to the browser, as if the strength of the browsers pull were more than the heading could resist. Creating white space, as I now see, can be an incredibly simple way to give your content emphasis, and power.</p> 

	<p>We spent some time meticulously going through my homepage, using my base line-height to create the aforementioned emphasis, as well as structure and improved readability. Now that my page relies on a consistent baseline grid for its structure and not the artificial structure provided by unnecessary decoration I need to work on a number of other things:</p> 

	<ol>
		<li>Researching web fonts and finding one that fits my voice.</li>

		<li>Simplifying any other unnecessarily decorative elements on my page (Icons!) to keep them in line with the simplicity of the page itself.</li>

		<li>And get rid of anything that may cause unnecessary confusion to the user, e.g. links to the current page in the navigation bar.</li> 
</ol>

<p>In addition to all of this, I need to improve my command line skills; during our last lesson we tried to do as much as possible using the command line terminal and Iâ€™m overwhelmed by how much more efficient it is than trawling through Finder or using the GitHub interface. So Bash tutorials, here I come!</p>
