	<p>I'm used to getting baffled responses when I tell people I want to be a competitive bodybuilder. It's something I've come to expect. I suspect a lot of people assume that that means I want to become a female Arnie, so muscular my biceps tear my sleeves, so broad I have to walk through doors sideways. That's not what I want, although even if it was, there really isn't anything wrong that, if that's what makes a person happy.<p>

	<p>But yes, I'm used to people not 'getting it'. In recent months though, on a few occasions, I've had a response that, the more I think about it, I realise it epitomises so much of what's wrong with our society's attitude towards women. It goes,<p>

	<p>"Oh, that's cool. Muscly women can still be sexy."<p>

	<p>Now, for simplicities sake, let's break down why this is such an offensive, misogynistic comment into manageable, bite-sized chunks.<p>


	<p>So first of all, let's take the suggestion that having muscles might detract from a woman's 'sexiness' in the first place. Now, setting aside the fact that by the time a bodybuilder (male or female) makes it onto a competition stage they're generally hungry, dehydrated and a little bit tipsy, muscularity is <em>under normal conditions</em> a marker of strength. How disturbing then that we live in a world where a woman who displays physical strength may be deemed less sexually attractive than a physically weak, dare I say it, vulnerable, woman. <p>

	<p>It's not that unfamiliar though, working in the fitness industry I've met many women who want to lose weight but are utterly terrified of gaining muscle. Imagine that, fear of becoming - and consequently looking - stronger. I've occasionally even had people criticise my ambitions and warn that "You'll end up looking like a man", because, of course, strength and muscles are a man's domain; whilst fragility and skinniness are the height of femininity. <p>


	<p>Beyond that, lies the erroneous assumption that I must, of course, be doing x (whatever x may be, in this case, bodybuilding) in order to be found sexually attractive. That is to say, whenever a woman does anything which intentionally alters her physical appearance, her goal must automatically be attracting a mate. <p>

	<p>Now call me crazy, but I actually do have ambitions and goals in life other than finding a man who wants to procreate with me. I'm also fairly certain that the same can be said for the vast majority of women. The trouble is, all too often we're treated as though our bodies are <strong>the thing we can achieve</strong>, whilst for our male counterparts they are more often seen as <strong>a means to achieving some goal</strong>. For me, aside from loving the challenging of building and sculpting muscle, I know that the stronger I get, the more capable I am at a myriad of tasks. From the fun stuff like rock climbing and running, to the mundane things like opening the lids of tightly screwed-on jars, or moving furniture.</p>

	<p>I have no interest in being weak, vulnerable and dependent upon others who hold more power than I do; not physically, not mentally, not economically, nor any way whatsoever. Yes, part of bodybuilding is sculpting a physique which looks a particular way, and yes, part of the motivation is an aesthetic appreciation of that particular form. But hey, guess what, that aesthetic appreciation is grounded in a love of strength, discipline and independence. It has precisely nothing to do with creating an object of sexual allure.<p>


	<p>Finally (and folks, this is a big one) hidden deep in that brief, loaded comment, lies the terrifying view that equates 'sexiness' to 'physical appearance'. Now, I don't know about you, but I live in the real world. Here, in the real world, thankfully, being attracted to another human being tends to be about more than just their body measurements.<p>

	<p>So often, we see the media depicting men as, not only handsome, but powerful, witty, courageous...an unending list of complex adjectives, all of which seem essential elements of the 'holistically perfect man'. Now, obviously, even that is fucking ridiculous. The very notion of there being some kind of Platonic form of the 'eligible gentleman' is only testament to the simplicity and stupidity of those responsible for creating him. However, at least that moronic meme goes beyond physical appearance. We ladies must make do with our 'form of the perfect woman' consisting of a purely physical description.<p>

	<p>Now, fine, you might lock eyes with some beautiful person, on the far side of a room, at a crowded party and think 'Wow, I have to meet them', but go talk to them and find out that they're an ignorant, bigoted, over-privileged, pro fox hunting, investment banker who considered Pacific Rim to be a cinematic masterpiece, and then tell me you still fancy them.<p> 

	<p>If you can, then you've either met your soulmate (and we can no longer be friends) or you possess the depth of a petri-dish (and we can no longer be friends).<p> 

	<p>For me and, happily, most of the people I know, attraction is a multifaceted thing. It's as much about a person's values, interests and attitudes, as it is about how they look. When you suggest that attraction comes down to nothing but physical appearance, you devalue all the exciting, interesting complexities that make a person unique.<p>

	<p>And when you assume that I wake up at 5:30am every day, head to the gym to squat, deadlift, curl and press until I feel like my muscles are going to explode, all in pursuit of your approval, well...then you're probably just an idiot.</p>
