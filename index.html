	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		
		<p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by. My name's Jo. I'm 26, I live in Brighton and this, <a href='index.html'><strong>right here</strong></a>, is my first website. Built from scratch. Properly. It may not be much right now, but over the coming months it's going to grow into something amazing.</p>

		<h2>What am I doing?</h2>

		<p>I'm currently taking my first, tentative steps on the journey towards web developing. I, like many others (I suspect) had always been fascinated by web design, but assumed I wasn't <em>smart enough</em> and was afraid I'd fail. I studied Cognitive Science at university, but avoided courses like 'Introduction to Programming' for fear of not understanding and looking like a fool. I wish I'd figured it out long ago, but eventually I realised, <strong>fear is not an excuse</strong> and hey, guess what? It turns out, I am smart enough.</p>

		 I'm 26 years old, I have a degree in Philosophy and Cognitive Science and right now I'm taking my first, tentative steps on the journey towards web developing.</p>

		<p><em>"Why?"</em> I hear you ask. <em>"Surely with a degree in Philosophy you have a ready made career waiting for you, society is literally crying out for young, female philosophers to make sense of life, the universe and everything. There must be a red leather Chesterfield armchair somewhere just waiting for your arse to be imprinted on it."</em></p>

		 <p>You'd think. I have learned a lot of things from my degree, some of which I will come to talk about as I develop this page. I'm particularly interested in political philosophy, ethics and logic. The first two I hope to write about as time allows, the last, I hope, will provide me with the much needed grounding to go from WebDev Novice to WebDev Ninja at record speed. However, perhaps the most poignant nugget of wisdom I obtained during my degree was that society, as a whole, is oblivious as to the enormous value of philosophy (Again, I'll return to this later).</p>

		<h2>Web Developing</h2>

		<p>So, my friend <a href='http://www.aralbalkan.com'>Aral</a> is a bit of a genius when it comes to this web lark and, it turns out, an incredibly kind friend. He's guiding me through this terrifying new world, imparting wisdom and making <del>terrible</del> fantastic puns along the way.</p>
