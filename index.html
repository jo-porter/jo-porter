	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		
		<p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by. My name's Jo. I'm 26 years old, I have a degree in Philosophy and Cognitive Science and right now I'm taking the first, tentative steps on the journey towards web developing.</p>

		<p><em>"Why?"</em> I hear you ask. <em>"Surely with a degree in Philosophy you have a ready made career waiting for you, society is literally crying out for young, female philosophers to make sense of life, the universe and everything. There must be a red, leather Chesterfield armchair waiting for your arse to be imprinted on it."</em></p>

		 <p>You'd think. I have learned a lot of things from my degree, some of which I will come to talk about as I develop this page. I'm particularly interested in political philosophy, ethics and logic. The first two I hope to write about as time allows, the last, I hope, will provide me with the much needed grounding to go from WebDev Novice to WebDev Ninja at record speed. However, perhaps the most important nugget of wisdom I obtained during my time at university was that society, as a whole, is oblivious as to the enormous value of philosophy (Again, I'll return to this later).</p>
