	<h2 class='n1'>Who am I?</h2>
		
		<p class='n1'>Hi there, thanks for stopping by. My name's Jo. I'm 26, I live in Brighton and this, <a href='index.html'><strong>right here</strong></a>, is my first website. Built from scratch. Properly. It may not be much right now, but over the coming months it's going to grow into something amazing.</p>

		<h2 class='n2'>What am I doing?</h2>

		<p class='n2'>I'm currently taking my first, tentative steps on the journey towards web developing. I, like many others (I suspect) had always been fascinated by web design, but assumed I wasn't <em>smart enough</em> and was afraid I'd fail. I studied Cognitive Science at university, but avoided courses like 'Introduction to Programming' for fear of not understanding and looking like a fool. I wish I'd figured it out long ago, but eventually I realised, <strong>fear is not an excuse</strong> and hey, guess what? It turns out, I am smart enough.</p>

		

		<h2 class='n3'>Web Developing</h2>

		<p class='n3'>So, my friend <a href='http://www.aralbalkan.com'>Aral</a> is a bit of a genius when it comes to this web lark and, as it happens, an incredibly kind friend. He's guiding me through this terrifying new world, imparting wisdom and making <del>terrible</del> fantastic puns along the way.</p>
