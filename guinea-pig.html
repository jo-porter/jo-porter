	<h2>Jo's top 3 reasons for writing blog posts:</h2>

	<ol>
	<li>To convey an important message</li>
	<li>To improve her writing skills</li>
	<li>To motivate her to follow through on a commitment.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Today is all about 3.</p>

	<p>On Thursday evening, I decided that, for a number of reasons, right now was as good a time as any to conduct a little experiment on myself. This is as much an experiment in my own self-discipline and will-power as it is in my physiology. </p>

	<p>That being said, if I do ever want to reach a competitive standard of bodybuilding the one thing I need to do better is eating. I train hard, but I like training hard, that's never been a problem. But training hard means nothing unless you can demonstrate absolute discipline in what fuels the machine. </p>

	<p>Problem is, I'm not such a big fan that. It's easy to master something you enjoy, mastering something you hate - that takes real dedication. But that's exactly what I need to do. </p>

	<p>So, here comes 10 days of a brutally strict shredding diet. 10 days of nothing but chicken, asparagus, almonds and protein shakes. Yum.</p>

	<p>I know I have some peculiar traits and I know plenty of people would see these kinds of strict dietary restrictions as unhealthy, whether it's physically or psychologically. But I maintain that every decision we make is a trade-off, there's almost always a negative side to every positive, so we make our own value judgements and base our decisions on them. I decided that, even if it's just once in my life, I want to compete in (and hopefully win) a bodybuilding competition. I've placed a great deal of value on that, so for me, making these kinds of sacrifices are worth it. </p>

	<p>Of course, that's Morning-Of-Day-Two-Jo's perspective. Let's see how committed, and for that matter, coherent, day 8, or day 9 Jo is. </p>

	<p>I want to document these 10 days, not only to motivate me to continue, but out of curiosity in my own psychology. Down the rabbit hole I go, etc.</p>
