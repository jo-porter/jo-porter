<p><em>Please forgive (and be prepared for) my briefly nauseating prose.</em></p>

<p>Imagine for a moment that you live in a world where there is no such thing as money. Wealth and poverty have no anchor to tie themselves to and your options in life are not relative to your financial status. All your decisions are made out of personal preference, based on what would make you happy, not what you can 'afford'.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself, how would you live? What would your day-to-day existence look like? Would you drive a McLaren F1? Would you live in a house so vast that it took you 10 minutes to walk from bedroom to kitchen? Would you spend every summer on a yacht, 100 yards from the shore of an isolated tropical-paradise island? I wouldn't.</p>

<p>Obscene wealth is, sadly, overtly present in our society. Consequently, it's not uncommon to hear people musing on what they'd do if they were billionaires. Often the answer involves the kinds of activities that are currently reserved for those in possession of extreme wealth. You'd fly everywhere in your own private helicopter, be a space tourist, employ a team of full-time servants, etc., etc. </p>

<p>But I wonder how much of the appeal of such things is founded in their exclusivity. How much of it is the tragically human propensity towards wanting whatever's out of reach. I flew in a helicopter once, it was fucking horrible. My dominant residual memory is of a noisy, precarious flying box and the overwhelmed fear of decapitation. </p>

<p>"When you get out, you step out. DO NOT JUMP."</p>

<p>Alright Mr Public-liability-insurance, if you have to say this to a short 9 year old girl, I don't have much hope for the rest of you. If you asked me to use one as a regular mode of transportation, I'd ask you to sod off.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are plenty of awesome, fun things that, given the chance to experience, I'd enjoy. What I'm not so sure about is whether a perpetual existence made up of those things would equate to happiness. It's very easy to get those two mixed up - enjoyment and happiness. Superficially they have a lot in common, and I'll admit it's hard to imagine being happy in a life without enjoyment. Not impossible, I don't think, just hard to imagine. But it's precisely the superficiality of enjoyment that makes it so hard to imagine mere perpetual enjoyment equaling happiness.</p>

<p>A great deal of effort goes into convincing us that being super-rich is super-awesome. So it's no surprise that so many people do equate wealth (and all that they perceive it entailing) with happiness. And let's not forget that the belief that wealth = stuff, status, and therefore happiness is very useful. For those whose wealth comes from the continual efforts of the unwitting foot soldiers of capitalism, it's essential.</p>

<p>The point I'm trying to get at, albeit circumlocutorily, is that we've got it back to front. We've been conditioned to believe that wealth is both necessary, and sufficient, for happiness. So, we find ourselves reverse engineering happiness from the hypothetical position of wealth.</p>

<p>We ask ourselves 'What would you do if you had a billion dollars?'. Never mind what you would or wouldn't be willing to do to get it. Instead, surely we should be asking 'What do you need to make you happy?'. If your answer is a six bedroom house, a holiday home in the South of France, a new car every two years and a 30 ft yacht, well, I might doubt your judgement, but ok. So from that point you begin working out what you need to do in order to obtain those things. Trust me, you won't be needing billions. You'll most likely have to be, either, very smart and very dedicated, or, more likely, very open to morally questionable activities. But you definitely won't need billions.</p>

<p>However I suspect that for the vast majority of us, big houses, fast cars, etc. wouldn't be that high on the list. I suspect that for most of us, happiness comes as a result of meaningful experiences. The opportunity to engage with the things that matter to us; whether that be personal relationships, self-improvement, climbing mountains, building awesome products or anything else. If we stop for a moment and remove ourselves from the deeply ingrained misconception that wealth and stuff are to be prized above all else, we'll realise that happiness is actually a lot more attainable and sustainable than we've been led to believe. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, there should be aboslutely no difference between the answer to 'What would you do if you had a billion dollars?' and your answer to the scenario I posed at the beginning of this post. If there is a difference, then you're left with the uncomfortable reality that money - an abstract and artificial concept - is, for you, not a means to an end; but an end in itself. Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a pretty depressing basis for happiness.</p>

<p>Now just to be clear, I'm not for a second suggesting we discard all our money and possessions and live like buddhist monks. But in my experience, money and stuff are auxiliary. What matters is their capacity to create meaningful experiences for me. My computer is valuable to me because it allows me to work effectively and to stay informed about the world around me. My home is valuable to me because it's a welcoming, comfortable place for me to spend time with those I care about. But without a job that I love, people I love and a world with which I'm free to actively engage, these things are largely meaningless.</p>

<p>The misconception that wealth leads to happiness is a driving force behind the vast inequality in the world, that much is clear. What many people don't seem to realise (until it's too late), is that a preoccupation with wealth, is perhaps the biggest risk to our attainment of happiness.</p>

<p>Someone once asked me, on a first date of all things, what I wanted for my future; did I want children? If so, how many? What about a career? Marriage? To travel? I thought for a moment, and replied, simply, "Happiness." And really, what more could I possibly want.</p>
