	<h2>Let's Be Honest About Mental Health</h2>

	<img class="swimming-duck" alt="Duck swimming across a lake" src="images/duck.jpg">

	<p>Here are two not particularly interesting facts about me: firstly, I see a therapist. Secondly, I'm not ashamed about the first fact.</p>

	<p>It's not unusual for me to turn down an invitation to socialise, or reschedule plans because, "I'm seeing my therapist that evening". I never bother to think up a vague, ambiguous excuse, or just leave it at "I'm busy", because - and this is important - it's not something to feel embarrassed about.</p>

	<p>I just as often turn down an invitation to socialise because "I need to go to the gym". And I can't imagine anyone wasting a second of their time hiding their gym membership from those around them. And yet therapy, for me, is just that: An 'emotional gym'.</p>

	<p>Of course, therapy, much like a gym membership, is something which (for the most part) requires a certain level of privilege to access. I'm well aware of this and I don't take my privilege lightly; I'm very lucky. And, much like a gym membership, therapy is absolutely not the only way a person can work on their mental health. It's one way, and it's a way <em>I</em> find hugely rewarding, but I don't mean to pretend that it's the be-all and end-all of mental health. [Loved ones often make excellent listeners, and I've definitely gained a lot over the years from talking my problems through with those closest to me.]</p>

	<p>As I said, I recognise my privilege, and I believe that with privilege, comes responsibility. It's that sense of responsibility which I feel makes it so important that I be open and honest about the time and energy I put into maintaining good mental health.</p> 

	<p>It's great that people are starting to talk more about the importance of removing the taboos around mental health. And I have immense respect for every person who does openly talk about their struggles. There have been times in my life when depression has seemed so overwhelming and isolating that the last thing I would've wanted to do would be to write a blog post about it and put it out there for anyone to see; even if it would, in the long run, have been a hugely positive move. So for those people who do talk about it when life seems at its worst, my admiration has no bounds.</p>

	<p>For me, I'll be happy if I can make my own, tiny contribution by acknowledging that even for people who don't have it so bad, for those of us who have ups and downs but for the most part feel pretty good about life, it still requires work. Good mental health is not stasis, you don't just 'have it' or not. Just like good physical health, it's constantly changing and evolving with our environment, and we have to keep on top of it. I genuinely enjoy seeing my therapist, it's something I look forward to, like a massage or catching up with a friend. I don't 'need' it, in any desperate sense of the word (at the moment), but I believe I'm a better person because of it. Given that I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I can benefit from it, I consider it an obligation to myself.</p>

	<p>What does occur to me though, is this. Imagine if physical training, running, seeing a personal trainer, going to a gym, all had the same level of stigma attached to them as mental health. If every runner trained in secret and showed up for a marathon pretending they hadn't run once since the previous year. If every athlete behaved as though they were just 'naturally gifted' and didn't spend every minute of every day working on their ability. Imagine how intimidating it would be for someone who wanted to make those kinds of positive changes in their life, but found themselves surrounded by people who appear to just be 'born that way.</p>

	<p>Through all my years of working in the fitness industry, one of the most important realisations I had was that the vast majority of people want to know that it's hard for you too. There's nothing more demotivating than feeling like there's something intrinsically different about the people at the top of their game and you. If they're just 'like that', and you're 'just not', why even try?</p>

	<p>I know from my own experience that the same can be true of mental health. Feeling depressed is plenty alienating enough on its own. Combine that with an environment where nobody talks about their mental health struggles, or, only other people suffering as badly as you, and it's easy to find yourself feeling like there's something wrong with you, just because you're finding things harder right now.</p>

	<p>My sincere apologies if you consider yourself to be 100%, completely and utterly mentally flawless, but I tend to believe such a thing is impossible. Clich&eacute; though it may be, we are all a work in progress. It comes from not existing in a vacuum. </p>

	<p>Moreover, with the ability to curate our outward lives through social media, and so many of us only seeing the highlights of other people's lives, it's no wonder we end up feeling even worse about our off-days/weeks/months. In reality though, unless I'm very much mistaken, we're all, always working at being a-ok, whether we are right now, or not.</p>

	<p>I've always loved that old analogy about ducks - everything looking calm on the surface, but underneath, paddling like crazy. That's me, and I'm pretty sure that's you too. Maybe it's time we started being honest about that.</p>
