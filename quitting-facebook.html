	<p>Remember the not-even-particularly-old days, when friends used to text you -  you personally - to invite you to their birthday or whatever? I know, it was time consuming and inefficient, and these days we're all about increasing efficiency, aren't we? It's so much more efficient to just set up an event, scroll down a page, mindlessly clicking faces as you go.</p>

	<p>Here's my question; what are we saving all this time for? What's on the other side of this optimisation drive? Are we all just streamlining our lives so that we can fit even more work into them? Or are we doing it because we want more time to spend on making meaningful connections with the people we love? By, oh I don't know, taking the time to write to them personally to invite them to your birthday?</p>

	<p>I can't help but worry that we've becoming so preoccupied with 'optimising all the things' that we've forgotten that sometimes it's the effort required that makes some things worth doing.</p>

	<p>However big a dopamine hit you get from a little red dot on your screen, believe me, knowing that someone thought of you and took the time to write to you - specifically you - is way, way better.</p>
