<p>So, over the last few weeks and months Laura and I have covered a huge amount of html and css. We've looked at accessibility, responsive design and mobile first, we've tackled forms, styled buttons and discussed a hundred and one other aspects of web design. My task now, if I choose to accept it (spoiler alert: I do) is to code one of Laura's designs. We're going to take it bit by bit, week by week. Below you will find the weekly additions to the project and in a few weeks, you'll find a beautifully coded webpage.</p>
